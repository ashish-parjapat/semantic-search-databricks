# üß† News Article Semantic Search with Sentence Transformers + FAISS on Databricks

This project implements a **semantic search engine** for news articles using **Sentence Transformers for vector embeddings** and **FAISS for similarity search**, entirely built and run on **Azure Databricks**.

---

## üîç Project Objective

The goal is to enable semantic (meaning-based) search across a collection of news articles. Instead of relying on keyword matches, we embed articles using **MiniLM** model and use **vector similarity** to find the most relevant content.

## üìÅ Dataset

We use a news dataset that contains:

- `headline`: Title of the article  
- `category`: News category (e.g., politics, tech)
- `date`: Date of publication  
- `description`: Summary  
- `text`: Full content of the article
